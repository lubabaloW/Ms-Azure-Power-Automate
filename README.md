# Ms-Azure-Power-Automate
# Overview
--These projects focus on Microsoft Azure and Power Automate. Each project builds on the previous one.
--I designed these projects to help me gain hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure and Power Automate, and equip myself with practical skills for real-world applications.


# Project 1: Azure Storage and Power Automate Integration
Title: Automate File Processing with Azure Blob Storage and Power Automate
 
# Description:
In this project, you will set up an Azure Blob Storage account to store files and use Power Automate to create a flow that triggers when a new file is uploaded. The flow should include actions such as renaming the file, moving it to a specific container, and sending a notification email with file details.
 
Steps:
Set up an Azure Storage account and create a Blob Storage container.
Configure Power Automate to trigger when a new file is uploaded to the container.
Add actions to rename the file, move it to another container, and send an email notification.
Learning Objectives:
Understand Azure Blob Storage setup and configuration.
Learn how to create and manage flows in Power Automate.
Automate file processing and notification workflows.

# Project 2: Azure Functions and Power Automate for Data Processing
# Title: Serverless Data Processing with Azure Functions and Power Automate
 
Description:
You will create an Azure Function to process data and use Power Automate to trigger this function based on specific events. For example, you could process JSON data files uploaded to Blob Storage, extract information, and store the results in Azure Table Storage.
 
Steps:
Develop an Azure Function to process JSON data.
Configure Power Automate to trigger the Azure Function when a new JSON file is uploaded to Blob Storage.
Extract information from the JSON file and store it in Azure Table Storage.
Send a summary email with the processed data.

Learning Objectives:
Learn about Azure Functions and serverless computing.
Integrate Azure Functions with Power Automate.
Automate data extraction and storage workflows.

# Project 3: End-to-End Workflow Automation with Azure Logic Apps and Power Automate
# Title: Comprehensive Workflow Automation Using Azure Logic Apps and Power Automate
 
Description:
This project involves creating a comprehensive end-to-end automation solution using multiple Azure services and Power Automate. You will integrate Azure Logic Apps with Azure SQL Database, Blob Storage, and Power Automate to handle data ingestion, processing, and reporting.
 
Steps:
Set up an Azure SQL Database and create a table for storing data.
Develop an Azure Logic App to handle data ingestion from various sources (e.g., API, Blob Storage).
Use Power Automate to trigger data processing workflows, such as transforming data and inserting it into the SQL Database.
Create a reporting dashboard (e.g., Power BI) to visualize the data stored in Azure SQL Database.

Learning Objectives:
Understand the capabilities of Azure Logic Apps for workflow automation.
Integrate multiple Azure services into a cohesive solution.
Automate complex workflows involving data ingestion, processing, and reporting.
